    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1 large egg</strong></li>
        <li><strong>½ teaspoon salt</strong></li>
        <li><strong>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</strong></li>
        <li><strong>1 pound ground beef</strong></li>
        <li><strong>½ cup fine dry bread crumbs</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade lasagna:
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.</li>
        <li>Whisk together egg, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Add ground beef and bread crumbs and mix with your hands or a fork until well blended.</li>
        <li>
            <p>Place patties on the preheated grill. Cover and cook 6 to 8 minutes per side, or to</p>
            <p>desired doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should</p>
            read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
